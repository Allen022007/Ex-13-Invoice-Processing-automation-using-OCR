## Aim
To automate the extraction of key information (Invoice Number, Date, and Total Amount) from a scanned invoice PDF using OCR technology in UiPath and store the extracted data into an Excel file.

## Materials Required
UiPath Studio

Tesseract OCR or Microsoft OCR (included in UiPath)

Invoice PDF file (scanned or image-based)

UiPath.Excel.Activities

UiPath.PDF.Activities

Basic understanding of Regular Expressions (Regex)

Microsoft Excel

## Procedure
Step 1: Prepare the Project
Create a new project in UiPath Studio called InvoiceOCRBot.

Place your Invoice PDF in the project folder for easy access.

Step 2: Read the Invoice using OCR
Use the Read PDF with OCR activity (from UiPath.PDF.Activities).

Set the file path to your invoice PDF.

Use Tesseract OCR or Microsoft OCR engine.

Output: ocrText (String variable)

Step 3: Extract Data Using Regex
Use Assign activities to extract data:


invoiceNumber = System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.Match(ocrText, "Invoice Number[:\s]*([A-Za-z0-9\-]+)").Groups(1).Value  
invoiceDate = System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.Match(ocrText, "Date[:\s]*([0-9\/\-]+)").Groups(1).Value  
totalAmount = System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.Match(ocrText, "Total Amount[:\s]*([\d,]+\.\d{2})").Groups(1).Value  
 Modify the Regex pattern based on your PDFâ€™s layout.

 Step 4: Create and Write to Excel
Use a Build Data Table activity to create a table with columns:
Invoice Number, Date, Total Amount

Use Add Data Row to insert extracted values.

Use Write Range activity to save the data to InvoiceData.xlsx.

Step 5: Run and Verify
Run the bot.

Open the InvoiceData.xlsx file to check if the data is entered correctly.

## OUTPUT:
For a PDF with:

Invoice Number: INV-1023  
Date: 12/05/2024  
Total Amount: 5,250.00
The Excel output will be:

Invoice Number	Date	Total Amount
INV-1023	12/05/2024	5,250.00

## Result
The UiPath robot successfully extracted key data from an image-based PDF using OCR and saved it in an Excel file for further use.
